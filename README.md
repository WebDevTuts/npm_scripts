# Lynda - Tooling With NPM Scripts

While Gulp, Grunt, and Bower are great tools, Node.js offers an alternative for implementing build processes: npm and your package.json file. npm (node package manager) is all about creating custom scripts for common development and production tasks. You can write npm scripts to process and compress code, create services, minify images, and automate all sorts of build tasks. This course shows you the advantages and few disadvantages of working with npm scripts and the steps for scripting different development and build tasks. Even if you don't use npm for your own processes, many Node.js packages come with npm scripts built in. This is a great course to help you understand how they work.

You can view demo site at master [branch /docs](http://edwinchen.co/npm_scripts).
